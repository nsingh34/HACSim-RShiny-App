# HACSim-RShiny-App

This is the HACSim R Shiny web app! It offers all the same core functionality as the HACSim R package available for download through the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).

Primarily, the HACSim R Shiny web app is intended for those users who aren't sure whether the HACSim R package is the tool they need, or for those who lack confidence in their R programming abilities.

Users can access the app in three ways:

- Through directly downloading the HACSim-RShiny-App GitHub repository from GitHub and running it locally on their operating system; or,
- Through directly accessing the R Shiny server (https://www.shinyapps.io); or,
- Through directly launching the app from the HACSim R package itself.

**Note**: Depending on the magnitude of inputted parameters, users may wish to employ the HACSim R package directly through R, especially for long simulation runtimes

A short manuscript outlining the tool is in preparation. For now, users can follow the Tutorial within the app.
